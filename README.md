# The Logos Project

The put your logos skills to the test. This is the official repository of a currently in-development project that aims to create a free and user-friendly website where users can easily create tests, especially with mathematical content, share them, save them to a neat PDF-file or add a restricted access. In addition, public test can be taken and rated by other users, which ensures that only the best tests are provided to the user.

## Who should use it?

No matter if you're a teacher, a student or just an enthusiast, you can make use of this website! For teachers, it provides a user-friendly interface to create problems, including an option to generate a random problem for a set of topics. These can later be saved as either digital tests, with invite links and automatic evaluation, or as a PDF file. For students, this platform can be used to either practice on user-created tests or select a template with topics and receive random questions on them(for arbitrary topics only)
