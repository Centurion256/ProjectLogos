# The Logos Project

Put your logos skills to the test. This is the official repository of a currently in-development project that aims to create a free and user-friendly platform where users can easily create tests, especially with mathematical content, share them, save them as a neat PDF-file or make them private. In addition, public test can be taken and rated by other users, which ensures that only the best tests are provided to the user.

## Who should use it?

No matter if you're a teacher, a student or just an enthusiast, you can make use of this website! For teachers, it provides a user-friendly interface to create problems, including an option to generate a random problem for a set of topics. These can later be saved as either digital tests or as a PDF file. For students, this platform can be used to either practice on user-created tests or generate tests with random questions based on selected topics(for arbitrary topics only)

## Used APIs

- [Math.ly](https://math.ly) - random questions
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#about) - Math rendering on the webpage
- [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/) - User-friendly mathematical input 

## Contributing
Since this project was first created as an assignment for the CS course, you can't contribute until it is considered to be finished in terms of the assignment(until the end of May 2019). Afterwards, you can contribute to it if you wish.
